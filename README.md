#HackHPC Event Pages

**Purpose**

The hackathons aim to harness the resources, skills, and knowledge found in the HPC community in an effort to provide applied exposure towards the conference host city local students of 2-4 year post-secondary educational institutions. These issues can range from societal to scientific, utilizing available subject area specialists. In short, the hackathon will provide HPC skills and training while targeting problems that directly affect the participants. The hackathon is being planned from the outset as a virtual event.
